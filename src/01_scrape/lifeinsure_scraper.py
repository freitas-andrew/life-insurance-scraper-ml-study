IMPORTANT NOTE:
At the time of data collection, the site https://quoter.lifeinsure.com did not and still does not appear to have scraping restrictions in place ‚Äî either via
a restrictive robots.txt file or active enforcement mechanisms. Scraping was conducted carefully and responsibly over multiple days without interuption, 
indicating that restrictions were absent or not actively enforced during that period. However, an eventual IP block (which only occurred after the aforementioned 
prolonged access), suggests that stricter anti-bot measures were introduced after the main bulk of the data collection, or that excessive scraping raised a flag.

CAUTION: 
Although the scraping programme still works ‚Äî and limited scrapinng seems to garner no immediate action ‚Äî future scraping attempts (especially in high volumes) on this site 
may lead to an IP ban for this website, or other enforcement actions, as current restrictions appear to be more aggressive than during the original data collection.
